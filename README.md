# AWS_SQS_LAMBDA
------------------------

Using the SQS model, for creating and sending queued messages.


This is a test, just sending a simple message and calling it through a lambda function, with the ID and Name parameters in the message.

-----
If you wanted to test it, just have an AWS account and run the Git Clone command.

The result should appear in Cloud Watch as:
Name: teste sqs ID:1
